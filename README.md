Flatplane
=========

Flatplane is a frontend to [TCPDF](http://www.tcpdf.org/) to create scientific reports with automatic formatting, inspired by TeX, LaTeX and it derivates.
It is currently very unfinished, and very buggy. 

It uses [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax) via [svgtex](https://github.com/Gefrierbrand/svgtex) and [Phantomjs](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs) to create nice equations.

Development on it hast stopped for the moment, but this might change with the upcoming refactored TCPDF version.
